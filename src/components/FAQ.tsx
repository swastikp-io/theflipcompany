    question: "How do we get started?",
    answer: "Pick a package — and we’ll send you a quick form to fill out. It helps us build a clear brief. Then we hop on a call to talk through the details and get started."
  },
  {
    question: "I'm not sure what I need. Can we chat first?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Book a free intro call and we can discuss your needs and find the right fit."
  },
  {
    question: "What are your payment terms?",
    answer: "We typically require a 50% deposit upfront to secure your spot in our schedule, and the remaining 50% upon project completion."
  },
  {
    question: "What about revisions?",
    answer: "Each package includes a set number of revisions. We want to ensure you are 100% happy with the final result."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I upgrade my package later?",
    answer: "Yes, you can always upgrade your package or add individual services as needed during the project."
